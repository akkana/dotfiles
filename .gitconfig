# Oh, lovely. git 1.7.11 mandates having something here, but if you
# pick the default (simple) then your .gitconfig won't work with
# 1.7.10 or earlier. So you get to choose to be nagged every time
# in the new git, or have the old git not work.
# Apparently "matching" is sorta like "simple" and only slightly
# less safe, deprecated in 1.7.11 but at least it actually exists
# in both versions.
